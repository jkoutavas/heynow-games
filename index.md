## Checkers

This is a Unity 3D project that is currently in early development. It's a "checkers with super powers" game, modeled after a classic Flash game that was popular from a few years ago. The intention is primarily for me to learn Unity development and build-up some development tools and art processing skills. There is also a desire to play this game with friends after it gets into a playable state. As far as releasing it as an actual publicly available game, that's a whole 'nother thing to look at well after the game is playable with friends, if ever.

The source code for the project is currently in a private github repository. It is based on a couple of things I've developed alongside the project, which are in public github repos:

* [unity-project-template](https://github.com/jkoutavas/unity-project-template)
* [unity-modular-textures](https://github.com/jkoutavas/unity-modular-textures)

Right now, I'm focused on building out the game mechanics, which are very nicely coming together with the "game engine" in the backend, separate from the UI front-end, in this case Unity, and a test Console app. You can read about this design pattern in the "unity-project-template" cited above.

## A video of the current state of the project
The look and feel of the game is very simple and rough at this stage of development. I'll occasionally post videos here as development progresses.
